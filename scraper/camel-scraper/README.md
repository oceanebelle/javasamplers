Purpose: 

Use Spring Boot, Camel http4 to fetch a target URL and make the dom content available for manipulation.

Lessons Learned: 
1. Spring Boot 1.5 is compatible with Camel 2.21
2. Spring Boot 2.0 is compatible with Camel 2.22
3. Use of exchange headers to manipulate invocation of camel http4. ie provide dynamic urls
